ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Prachi-tech
ðŸŽ“ I'm currently a third-year B.Tech student in Information Technology at College of Technology, Pantnagar University.

ðŸ§  Iâ€™m deeply interested in the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and actively learning about both supervised and unsupervised learning techniques. I enjoy understanding how intelligent systems work and how they can be applied to real-world problems.

ðŸ’¡ I believe in continuous learning and improvement, and Iâ€™m currently strengthening my core computer science fundamentalsâ€”especially in object-oriented programming, data structures, and algorithms.

ðŸš€ What I'm Working On:

Building smart and efficient applications using Python

Exploring machine learning models and working on beginner-level ML projects

Participating in coding challenges to sharpen my problem-solving and analytical skills

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m always curious to explore new tools, libraries, and technologies that can help me grow as a developer and as a tech enthusiast.
